/*
A stack is a list of values that grows and shrinks dynamically. A stack may be implemented as an Array that uses two Array methods: 
Array.prototype.push and Array.prototype.pop.

A stack-and-register programming language is a language that uses a stack of values. Each operation in the language operates on a 
register, which can be thought of as the current value. The register is not part of the stack. An operation that requires two 
values pops the topmost item from the stack (i.e., the operation removes the most recently pushed value from the stack), operates 
on the popped value and the register value, and stores the result back in the register.

Consider a MULT operation in a stack-and-register language. It removes the value from the stack, multiplies the removed stack 
value with the register value, then stores the result back in the register. For example, if we start with a stack of [3, 6, 4] 
(where 4 is the topmost item in the stack) and a register value of 7, the MULT operation mutates the stack to [3, 6] (the 4 is 
removed), and the result of the multiplication, 28, is left in the register. If we do another MULT at this point, the stack is 
mutated to [3], and the register is left with the value 168.

Write a function that implements a miniature stack-and-register-based programming language that has the following commands 
(also called operations or tokens):
n : Place a value, n, in the register. Do not modify the stack.
PUSH : Push the register value onto the stack. Leave the value in the register.
ADD : Pop a value from the stack and add it to the register value, storing the result in the register.
SUB : Pop a value from the stack and subtract it from the register value, storing the result in the register.
MULT : Pop a value from the stack and multiply it by the register value, storing the result in the register.
DIV : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value, storing the integer result back in the register.
REMAINDER : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value, storing the integer remainder of the division 
  back in the register.
POP : Remove the topmost item from the stack and place it in the register.
PRINT : Print the register value.
All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and REMAINDER).

Programs will be supplied to your language function via a string argument. Your function may assume that all arguments are valid programs
â€” i.e., they will not do anything like trying to pop a non-existent value from the stack, and they will not contain any unknown tokens.

Initialize the stack and register to the values [] and 0, respectively.

P:
- Register is the current value but NOT part of the stack
- Each operation operates on the register
- The second value (if required) is popped from the top of the stack
  - The evaluated value is stored in the register
- Follow the list of operations accordingly
- Initialize the stack and register to the values [] and 0, respectively.
n : Place a value, n, in the register. Do not modify the stack.
PUSH : Push the register value onto the stack. Leave the value in the register.
ADD : Pop a value from the stack and add it to the register value, storing the result in the register.
SUB : Pop a value from the stack and subtract it from the register value, storing the result in the register.
MULT : Pop a value from the stack and multiply it by the register value, storing the result in the register.
DIV : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value, storing the integer result back in the register.
REMAINDER : Pop a value from the stack and divide the register value by the popped stack value, storing the integer remainder of the division 
  back in the register.
POP : Remove the topmost item from the stack and place it in the register.
PRINT : Print the register value.
All operations are integer operations (which is only important with DIV and REMAINDER).

Input: string
Output: number(s) when PRINT is specified

E: below

D:
stack is an array
register is a number

A: 
- create function minilang with str param
  - create register to value zero
  - create stack to an empty array
  - split the string into individual commands (split by ' ')
  - iterate through each array item
    - write case statements for each potential action
      - when element is a number, reassign register to current element
      - when element is PUSH, push register onto stack
      - when ADD, pop value from stack (rightmost element) and add it to the register (reassign)
      - when SUB, pop value from stack (rightmost element) and subtract it from the register (reassign)
      - when MULT, pop and multiply and store in register
      - when div, ...
      - when remainder, divide register by popped value and store remainder
      - when POP, pop topmost item from stack and place it in the register
      - when PRINT, print register value
