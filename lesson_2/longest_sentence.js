// Write a program that determines the sentence with the most words in some text. Sentences may end with periods (.), 
// exclamation points (!), or question marks (?). Sentences always begin with a word character. You should treat any 
// sequence of characters that are not spaces or sentence-ending characters, as a word. Log the longest sentence and 
// its word count to the console. Pay attention to the expected output. Note that this problem is about manipulating 
// and processing strings. As such, every detail about the string matters (e.g., case, punctuation, tabs, spaces, etc.).
