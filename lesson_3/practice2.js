// Given an array of integers, nums, return the third largest number in the array. 
// If the third largest number does not exist, return the greatest number.

// You are not allowed to sort the array.

thirdMax([3, 2, 1]); // 1

// Will we always receive precisely one argument? If not, what should I do if the array is omitted? 
  // What should I do if there is more than one argument?
// Will the argument always be an array? If not, what should I do?
// Can the array be empty? If so, what should I return?
// Can the array have fewer than three elements? If so, what should I return?
// Can the array be sparse? If so, how should I handle the missing elements?
// Can the array contain any number of elements?
// Will the array ever contain negative numbers or 0? If so, how should I handle those?
// Will the array ever contain non-integers? If so, how should I handle those?
// Will the array ever contain NaN? If so, how should I handle that?
// Will the array ever contain Infinity? If so, how should I handle that?
// Will the array ever contain -Infinity? If so, how should I handle that?
// Can the numbers in the array appear in any order? For instance, might I receive a [1, 3, 2] array? Does this affect the result in any way?
// Can the array have repeated numbers, e.g., [3, 3, 1]? If so, how should I handle those? 
  // Should I handle the two 3s as different numbers and return 1, or should I return the largest number, 3?â€‹
