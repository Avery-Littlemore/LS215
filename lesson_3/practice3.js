// Write a function, primeNumberPrinter, that prints all prime numbers present as substrings in a given string.

primeNumberPrinter("a4bc2k13d"); // [2, 13]

// Will we always receive precisely one argument? If not, what should I do if the string is omitted? 
  // What should I do if there is more than one argument?
// Will the argument always be a string? If not, what should I do?
// Should I return an empty array if the string doesn't contain any prime numbers or any digits at all?
// Can the string be empty? If so, should I return an empty array?
// Can the string contain any number of characters?
// Suppose the string has adjacent digits, as in the example above? 
  // Would 13 only be number 13, or can I also consider it as two separate numbers, 1 and 3?
// If the string has three consecutive numbers, like 123. Should I consider 12 and 23 as separate numbers?
// In what order should the numbers be listed in the output array? Is it the order that the numbers appear in the string? 
  // If so, how should I treat numbers that are part of a larger number like 23 in the above number 123? Should 23 be printed before 123 or not?
// Can the string contain negative numbers, such as "a-4bc2k-13d"? What should I do in this case?
